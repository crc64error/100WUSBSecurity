# 100WUSBSecurity
Setup a 100 watt solar panel, charger, battery, network to power security cameras and garage.

I have 2 Simplisafe Wireless Cameras, a detached garage with no power with a garage door opener.

Currently, I have to retrieve the cameras every couple of weeks, remove the battery and charge them in my office for a day.  I then replace the batteries and reposition them outside. I would like to provide usb power for up to 6 cameras.

The garage had power at one time but, it was installed in an unsafe manner.  I would like to install my 100 watt system in the garage.  I would like the garage door opener and one or two lights to be powered by the batteries.  From there I will pull a wire to the house to provide usb power to 6 usb power outlets along the eaves of the house.
